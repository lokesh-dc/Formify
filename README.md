# 📝 Formify – Build Beautiful Forms in Minutes

Formify is a modern, customizable form builder that makes collecting information a breeze.  
Think Google Forms — but faster, prettier, and built with devs and creators in mind.

I’ve been developing Formify over time as a passion project to explore better, more customizable form-building experiences.
